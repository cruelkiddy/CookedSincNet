## Brief
This repo is almost copied from [SincNet](https://github.com/mravanelli/SincNet)

This project is our DSP final project 

What we did is applying the network to our proposed data set **MyTIMIT** 

And make prediction based on our trained model

## MyTIMIT
This data set consists of 32 wav files(sampling rate: 16kHz, normalized to (-1,1). 8 files per person. Language: Mandarin) in the folder MyTIMIT
